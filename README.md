## Abstract
<p align = "justify">
In this research, we aim to find and automatize an optimal policy to credit limit adjustment, a fundamental problem for banking and fintech companies that offer credit card products, using Reinforcement learning techniques. This problem requires the optimization of the expected profit given the performed actions for the portfolio of credit card customers; with this purpose, we have to balance two different objectives, first, maximize the portfolio's renewal and minimize the portfolio's provisions. 

To apply reinforcement learning techniques, we use an offline learning strategy that needs the simulation of the impact of the action based on historical data provided by a Supper-App company in Latin America. Our work gives insights into the impact of alternative data used to make decisions about credit adjustment limits in credit card portfolios, as well as a new objective technique to make these decisions that are primarily based on expert-driven systems instead of data-driven methods.
